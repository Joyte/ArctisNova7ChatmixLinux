# Arctis Nova 7 Chatmix Linux
This python-based program allows the user to use the Chatmix dial on their Arctis Nova 7 to control the volume between to audio devices.

It may work with other later or earlier models of the Arctis series, but I have only tested it with the Arctis Nova 7.

# Installation
Copy `50-arctis-nova-7.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`
